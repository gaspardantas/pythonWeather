# pythonWeather Project
## Getting started

To leverage Python's versatility and Flask's simplicity to develop a dynamic web application for retrieving and displaying real-time weather information, catering to users' need for instant weather updates.

By utilizing Python's powerful libraries and frameworks, particularly Flask, we seamlessly integrated backend functionality with front-end design, enabling users to input their desired city and receive accurate weather data in a visually appealing format.

This project encompasses a Python-based web application built using Flask, offering a user-friendly interface to access weather information for any major city. Leveraging the power of Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask, we've created an efficient and reliable solution for retrieving live weather data and deploying it on an instance server for seamless accessibility.
